<b><h1> Fight Club </h1></b>

<p> This is the repository for the ITP368 OOP-based project. Our project is a one player RPG game in which a player will have the option of either fighting enemies, collecting items, or using the items. We will expand on the game as the semester progresses and will eventually create a GUI to display gameplay. For now, the player will have to utilize the console for gameplay with menu options displayed after each turn. </p>
